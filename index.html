    <!-- PLACEMENT SYNOPSIS -->
    <section id="synopsis">
        <h2>Placement Synopsis</h2>
        
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>Industry Context</h3>
            <p>The Kimberley region has great plant biodiversity, and it’s one of those places where traditional knowledge hasn’t been wiped out. Traditional medicine has immense potential because there are thousands of medicinal plants out there, and knowing how to prepare them and what plants to analyse is extremely valuable information for drug discovery. Further, secondary metabolites in plants have a more complex structure than synthetic drugs, evidently, some believe they fit nature's blueprint, and reduce side-effects, making them a worthwhile area for investigation. 80% of plant-derived drugs are derived from traditional uses, but the scientific literature barely scratches the surface of Kimberley phytochemistry. Miaomiao Liu’s research group at GRIDD have connections going back decades with ongoing research associated with mudjala bark that has pain-relieving effects, however in the future the group will likely continue researching plants from this region. Their crew specifically hunts for molecular targets using mass spectrometry, but they were bottlenecked on the literature side. They were too busy writing grants and running assays to sift through the literature, thus, it was my job to conduct the analysis to find which plants are worth investigating further. The goal overall is to give Liu the evidence to chase competitive grants for Kimberley collaboration while the lab keeps running full steam on existing projects.</p>
                        
            <h3>Placement Role</h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Research assistant, most of the work was done independently with checkins and meetings. I focused on working Wednesdays and Thursdays and consistently worked throughout the whole duration on the goal of conducting this literature review. The literature was based on this Kimberley Bush medicine book by King & Horsfall (2023) to map traditional uses against phytochemical data in a review table. The book contains 326 plants, so covering that literature takes a substantial amount of time, with just two days per week over 12 weeks it was not expected that I would cover the whole book.</p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Primary deliverables at this stage include a good start on summarising secondary metabolites across 200 plants which had literature, the rest did not by utilising the LOTUS database, processing thousands of compounds. They were deduplicated with primary metabolites removed. This work was sent to Liu and she was quite pleased with that result, however there was stereochemistry missing in the SMILES strings which required some additional cleaning up, which is documented in the deliverables.<p>
			<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In addition to this, I facilitated a collaboration with four Medical Science students running a special topic on bush medicine. Met with them roughly weekly (seven sessions total), guided their literature methodology, reviewed their presentations, and attended their final symposium. Their scope was about 10 plants each, however they enjoyed the process and some want to continue onwards to try and contribute further, hoping to assist in more meaningful ways than through fulfilling simple course requirements. As such, they each offered some of their time to help to contribute to the final paper.<p>
			<p>Finally, a note about some things I did not mention, some of the deliverables have yet to be delivered, some of the work yet to be tidied up. I worked a lot on automating the process of conducting systematic literature review, due to the alarming size of the review I decided early on that I wanted to automate the search with AI agents. As a result I worked on my own AI agentic tool on the side - kind of like browser-use or manus but better and cheaper - and during some of my placement time, but never quite finished it. I am close to finishing it and intend on dramatically increasing the quality of the end-product of the literature review to make it more thorough. This work is part of the reason why I am extending my research with the group into a machine-learning docking project, which I am very excited for. All that in mind, I decided not to talk much about it and left it out, so if it seems like there were some gaps, it was because a lot of my effort has been invested into something not yet finished.<p>

    <!-- CRITICAL REFLECTION -->
    <section id="reflection">
        <h2>Critical Reflection on WIL Placement</h2>
        
        <div class="content-block">
            <h3>What I learned and Actually Delivered</h3>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This placement taught me that independence is a double-edged sword. I often worked remotely two days a week with minimal supervision, overall it required me to hold myself accountable. For the most part due to how interesting the project was, it was not much of an issue, however I often found myself having trouble when other commitments came up, like university quizzes or assignments, and I needed to put my research onto the side. When times were tougher, I did not have that same passion, and it was in those moments when being in the right environment would have helped. That being said, this semester I focused more on my research than my studies, while that might have been slightly to my downfall, I must admit I enjoyed working on the project and put extra time into trying to get some real deliverable work out there.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">One of the biggest realisations was that I should have gone into the office consistently, no matter what. Early on I was kind of unsure about coming into the office because I was doing a lot of coding. I did feel a need to keep my work a bit out of view because I was not sure if other people would share my views on attempting to automate something like a large-scale literature collection. I basically just worked remotely to give myself room to work on a solution for this problem, and being aware of the potential of new tools out there, I was committed to not manually toiling away at collecting thousands of papers. Ironically, the additional time investment that I put in could have resulted in an already finished end-product. Despite that however, I still feel that I gained valuable experience in AI tools that are at the bleeding edge of research, and my struggles have positioned me well for further research. It was not just AI and coding experience however, because I gained a tonne of problem-solving skills, and through a lot of focus I actually grew as a person. In the end I am left with a near finished product, and if I put some more effort in, the paper will soon be finished and published.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Further, the skills in coding and python that I gained were significant, I learnt more than I should have about AI, and my progress has still been appreciated by my supervisor. When I finally communicated the main focus of my work during the placement to my supervisor, after presenting a deliverable data table from the LOTUS database (covered in deliverables), Liu was quite pleased actually. She was open-minded to my approach to using AI in the end as this meant a higher quality end-product due to the scale of the research task at hand, and not long after I started coming into the office again.</p>
            
            <p>The deliverable isn't something tangible at this moment, but it's more about the potential to come. A literature review coming soon, a machine learning project moving quickly, and a lot of momentum.</p>

            <h4>Artefact 2: Python Script for SMILES Stereochemistry Fix</h4>
            <p>Miamiao Liu upon receiving the lotus_compounds_filtered dataset from before noticed an issue with the stereochemistry being missing from the SMILES codes.</p>
            <p>That means there isn't enough detail in the structures, there are details being left out which matter, in order to update these SMILES codes I used a script.</p>
            <p>The script went to a chemistry database (PubChem) and used the keys which were available for each compound to search for the accurate SMILES codes where applicable with a 98.5% success rate. The remaining 1.5% are flagged for manual review by not having a SMILES code.</p>
            <p>A fallback was included if the InchiKey used on PubChem did not result in finding a SMILES code through attempting to use the title instead to improve reliability. Overall the script did better than expected and the issue was resolved quickly.</p>

        <div class="artefact-card">
            <h4>Artefact 3: Machine learning for molecular docking: Preliminary testing results</h4>
            <p>I am working on a research proposal for a machine learning topic, so I started conducting background research.</p>
            <p>After conducting a little bit of research, I decided to test out a few tools, starting off with a basic test with static protein machine learning blind docking + physics based scoring.</p>
            <p>Translation: I grabbed the old technology for how researchers predict if a drug binds to a protein (useful for finding drug targets which are needed to put drugs on the market). I tried out this old technology which uses the trial and error method for sticking drugs onto proteins, and you don't even need to tell the machine where to stick, it will do it blind (no hints).</p>
            <p>This technology wasn't modern like the new co-folding method, which is like alphafold but with an extra step, we fold the protein and also the drug as well to predict drug targets. As a result, while the first test worked fine and I gathered some scores from my input data and validated the pipeline, it was time to try out this fun new technology.</p>
            <p>This requires a lot of computational power, so I cracked open the piggy bank and invested into $1 worth of cloud compute in order to test it out for 1 hour using run-pod, which is a GPU-hosting service.</p>
            <p>Boltz-2 was used on 8 real drugs and proteins yielding scores for 7 (1 failed due to bad input data).</p>

            <h4>Artefact 4: Poster from collaboration with medical students who I assisted through their project, which was a very small-scale version of what I am doing (I have the whole book, they had 10 plants each).</h4>
            <p>Harsha Cikaluru is one of these bright group members who shared his poster with me. They each presented their posters at a symposium with 3 minute speeches and they got to answer questions as people walked around looking at their posters. There were four medical students in total.</p>
            <p>These medical students were keen about the research, well organised and we met about 7 times throughout the process, aiming for about every week, but we could not meet every single week due to travel commitments.</p>
